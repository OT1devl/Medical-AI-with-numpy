## Introduction

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The goal of this project is to facilitate automated pneumonia diagnosis by analyzing X-ray images using NumPy-based data processing techniques.

## Features

- **Image Processing:** Uses NumPy for handling and analyzing X-ray images.  
- **Custom Models:** Implements machine learning models without relying on high-level frameworks.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Includes metrics to assess model accuracy and efficiency.  

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- cv2  

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OT1devl/Pneumonia-diagnosis-with-numpy.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Pneumonia-diagnosis-with-numpy
   ```

3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure that X-ray images are located in the appropriate directory within the `datasets` folder.  

2. Run the training notebook to train the model:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook train.ipynb
   ```

3. Once trained, you can test the model's performance using the test notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook test.ipynb
   ```

## Project Structure
